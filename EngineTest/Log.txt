Rendering ideas:

Screen Space Emissive

- draw Diffuse to the SSAO buffer at half or quarter res (and then upscale to half) -> perform bilateral blur on both things in one pass

Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

- use second color for screen space reflection occlusion (rays = reflect(viewDir, normal)) to cut cubemap reflections from these areas.
